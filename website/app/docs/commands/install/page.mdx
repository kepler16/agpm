# install

Install all configured artifacts to their target directories.

## Usage

```bash
agpm install
```

Also available as `agpm sync`.

## What Happens

1. Reads your `agpm.json` configuration and configured targets
2. Resolves refs to SHAs (uses lock file if present)
3. Caches repo at SHA to `~/.agpm/cache/<sha>/`
4. Computes integrity hash (SHA256 of file contents)
5. Copies artifacts to enabled target directories only

## Target Directories

Artifacts are installed only to targets explicitly configured in `agpm.json`:

<Table>
  <Thead>
    <Tr>
      <Th>Target</Th>
      <Th>Skills Directory</Th>
    </Tr>
  </Thead>
  <Tbody>
    <Tr>
      <Td>`claude-code`</Td>
      <Td>`.claude/skills/<name>/`</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>`opencode`</Td>
      <Td>`.opencode/skills/<name>/`</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>`codex`</Td>
      <Td>`.codex/skills/<name>/`</Td>
    </Tr>
  </Tbody>
</Table>

## Lock File

When `agpm-lock.json` exists, install uses the pinned SHAs for reproducible installs. This ensures all team members get the exact same artifact versions.

## Examples

Basic install:

```bash
agpm install
```

After adding new artifacts:

```bash
agpm add anthropics/skills pdf
agpm install
```
