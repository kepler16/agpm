# install

Install all configured artifacts to their target directories.

## Usage

```bash
agpm install
```

Also available as:

```bash
agpm sync
```

## What Happens

1. Reads your `agpm.json` configuration
2. Resolves artifact SHAs (uses lock file if present)
3. Copies artifacts to all configured target directories

## Target Directories

By default, artifacts are installed to:

- `.claude/skills/<name>/` - Claude Code
- `.opencode/skills/<name>/` - OpenCode
- `.codex/skills/<name>/` - Codex

Custom targets can be configured in `agpm.json`.

## Lock File

When a `agpm-lock.json` exists, install uses the pinned SHAs for reproducible installs. This ensures all team members get the exact same artifact versions.

## Examples

Basic install:

```bash
agpm install
```

After adding new artifacts:

```bash
agpm add anthropics/skills pdf
agpm install
```
