# update

Update the lock file to the latest available versions.

## Usage

```bash
agpm update [artifact]
```

## Arguments

<Table>
  <Thead>
    <Tr>
      <Th>Argument</Th>
      <Th>Description</Th>
    </Tr>
  </Thead>
  <Tbody>
    <Tr>
      <Td>`artifact`</Td>
      <Td>Optional: specific artifact to update. If omitted, updates all.</Td>
    </Tr>
  </Tbody>
</Table>

## Examples

Update all artifacts:

```bash
agpm update
```

Update a specific artifact:

```bash
agpm update anthropics/skills/pdf
```

## What Happens

1. Fetches latest SHAs for each ref (tag/branch/HEAD)
2. Updates `agpm-lock.json` with new SHAs
3. Recalculates integrity hashes

For artifacts pinned to a branch (e.g., `pdf@main`), update resolves to the latest commit on that branch. For artifacts pinned to a tag or SHA, the SHA doesn't change.

## Important

After updating, you need to run `agpm install` to apply the changes:

```bash
agpm update
agpm install
```

## When to Update

- When you want the latest version of artifacts
- After upstream repositories have new commits
- When troubleshooting issues with outdated artifacts
