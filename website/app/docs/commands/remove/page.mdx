# remove

Remove an artifact from your configuration.

## Usage

```bash
agpm remove <artifact>
```

## Arguments

<Table>
  <Thead>
    <Tr>
      <Th>Argument</Th>
      <Th>Description</Th>
    </Tr>
  </Thead>
  <Tbody>
    <Tr>
      <Td>`artifact`</Td>
      <Td>The artifact identifier to remove</Td>
    </Tr>
  </Tbody>
</Table>

## Example

```bash
agpm remove anthropics/skills/pdf
```

## What Happens

1. Removes the artifact from `agpm.json`
2. Removes the artifact from `agpm-lock.json` (if present)
3. Does **not** delete installed files

## Note

The `remove` command only updates configuration files. Previously installed files in target directories remain until manually deleted or overwritten.

To completely remove an artifact:

```bash
agpm remove anthropics/skills/pdf
rm -rf .claude/skills/pdf
rm -rf .opencode/skills/pdf
rm -rf .codex/skills/pdf
```
