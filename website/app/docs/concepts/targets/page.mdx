# Targets

Where artifacts get installed.

## Overview

Targets define the directories where AGPM installs artifacts. By default, AGPM supports multiple AI coding tools and installs to all of them.

## Default Targets

<Table>
  <Thead>
    <Tr>
      <Th>Tool</Th>
      <Th>Directory</Th>
    </Tr>
  </Thead>
  <Tbody>
    <Tr>
      <Td>Claude Code</Td>
      <Td>`.claude/skills/<name>/`</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>OpenCode</Td>
      <Td>`.opencode/skills/<name>/`</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>Codex</Td>
      <Td>`.codex/skills/<name>/`</Td>
    </Tr>
  </Tbody>
</Table>

## How It Works

When you run `agpm install`:

1. Each artifact is copied to all configured target directories
2. Directory structure is created if it doesn't exist
3. Files are copied preserving the artifact's internal structure

## Custom Targets

You can configure custom targets in `agpm.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agpm.dev/schemas/agpm.json",
  "targets": {
    "custom-tool": ".custom-tool/skills"
  },
  "artifacts": ["anthropics/skills/pdf"]
}
```

## Disabling Targets

To install only to specific tools, configure only those targets:

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "claude": ".claude/skills"
  }
}
```
