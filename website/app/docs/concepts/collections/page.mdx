# Collections

Group related artifacts for easier management.

## Overview

Collections are curated groups of related artifacts that can be referenced and managed as a single unit. They make it easier to install a cohesive set of tools.

## Using Collections

Collections can be defined in source repositories and referenced in your configuration:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agpm.dev/schemas/agpm.json",
  "artifacts": [
    "anthropics/skills/productivity-collection"
  ]
}
```

## Creating Collections

Collections are defined in the source repository's discovery format. A collection references multiple artifacts that should be installed together.

## Benefits

- **Curated sets** - Install recommended combinations of tools
- **Simplified config** - One entry instead of many
- **Coordinated updates** - All collection artifacts update together
- **Organization** - Group artifacts by use case or domain

## Example Use Cases

- **Productivity suite** - Calendar, notes, task management skills
- **Development tools** - Git, testing, deployment skills
- **Data analysis** - Database, visualization, export skills
