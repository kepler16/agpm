# Concepts

Understanding the core concepts behind AGPM.

## Overview

AGPM (Agent Package Manager) manages artifacts for AI coding tools. It handles:

- **Discovery** - Finding artifacts in source repositories
- **Installation** - Copying artifacts to target directories
- **Versioning** - Locking artifacts to specific commits

## Key Concepts

### Sources

Source repositories contain artifacts that can be installed. AGPM supports multiple source formats including GitHub shorthand and full URLs.

### Discovery

AGPM automatically discovers artifacts in source repositories by looking for specific file patterns and structures.

### Collections

Collections are groups of related artifacts that can be managed together, making it easier to install curated sets of tools.

### Targets

Targets define where artifacts are installed. AGPM supports multiple AI tools including Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex.

## Workflow

The typical AGPM workflow:

1. **Add a source** - Register a repository containing artifacts
2. **Discover artifacts** - See what's available
3. **Add artifacts** - Select which ones you want
4. **Install** - Copy to your AI tool directories
5. **Update** - Keep artifacts current with upstream
