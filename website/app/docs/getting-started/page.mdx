# Getting Started

AGPM (Agent Package Manager) is a universal package manager for AI coding tool artifacts. It helps you manage skills, commands, and hooks across Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and other AI tools.

## Installation

Install AGPM globally using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm add -g @agpm/cli

# Using npm
npm install -g @agpm/cli

# Using yarn
yarn global add @agpm/cli
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize your project

Create an `agpm.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agpm.dev/schemas/agpm.json",
  "targets": {
    "claude-code": true
  },
  "sources": [],
  "artifacts": []
}
```

### 2. Add a source repository

Add a repository containing artifacts:

```bash
agpm source add anthropics/skills
```

This clones the repository and makes its artifacts available for installation.

### 3. Discover available artifacts

See what artifacts are available in a source:

```bash
agpm source discover anthropics/skills
```

### 4. Add an artifact

Add an artifact to your project:

```bash
agpm add anthropics/skills pdf
```

This adds the artifact reference to your `agpm.json`.

### 5. Install artifacts

Install all configured artifacts to your target directories:

```bash
agpm install
```

Artifacts are copied to the appropriate directories for each configured target (e.g., `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code).
